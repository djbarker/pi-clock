# Pi-Clock

Code to drive display hats attached to a Raspberry Pi.

My motivation was to make a small bed-side clock which would dial down the brightness to a minimum at night.
I found all previous alarm clocks I bought were too bright, even on minimum brightness.
As an added benefit running this on a Rasperry Pi with WiFi means that I could add additional displays such as a tube status.
